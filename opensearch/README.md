This roughly follows along with
<https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/install-and-configure/install-opensearch/docker/>,
being sure to put stuff in SOPS when applicable for Maximum Reproducibility™️

## Setup

First, run:

```
./dec_all.sh
```

To decrypt all stored `*.pem` self-signed certificates. Then, run:

```
cd alpine-envsubst && ./build-image.sh && cd ..
```

To build an `alpine-envsubst` image that will be used in our later
docker-compose.yml file.

## Running

```
./docker-compose up -d
```

The `docker-compose` script uses SOPS to put everything from secret files into
environment variables, then the docker-compose.yml puts those environment
variables into the containers as necessary.

## Overall Strategy

Uses JWTs as generated by my crossposter login frontend. I may want to move
that over here sometime, but keeping them separate still is fine enough for now
i guess.
